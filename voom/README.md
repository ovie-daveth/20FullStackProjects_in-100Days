# Voom: Low Budget Zoom Clone

## Introduction

A low budge zoom clone just for fun. This is the first of the 20 project i will be building in the next 100 Days. It is a zoom clone using the zegoCloud API for the video confernecing. 

## Description

An eight(8) page large web app for making 1-on-1 and video conferencing calls, this website uses zoom as a functional template not neccesarily with ux sameness. I followed a step by step approach building component by component and adding consistent logic as I go. You can choose who and how many people can join your meeting. I made that possible using the normal conditional statement. With firebase as my backend user will be authenticated to use the app and other pafe are protected hence without Login in, `#0969DA` ***you cannot use the feattures of the site***
